<!-- tpl:put name="content" --><H1>Eclipse RSS Reader</H1><P>The Eclipse RSS Reader is a set of Eclipse plug-ins that allow you to subscribe to and browse on-line RSS (aka Rich Site Summary, aka Really Simple Sindication, aka RDF Site Summary) feeds. The <A
			href="new-channel-wizard.html">New Channel Wizard</A> helps you create new  Channels in your workspace using your RSS feed as a source. You can browse your workspace Channel hierarchy using the <A
			href="channel-navigator.html">Channel Navigator</A>, or view a particular Channel's items in the <A
			href="channel-detail.html">Channel Detail</A> view. You can modify each Channel's properties using the <A
			href="channel-properties.html">Properties</A> dialog, and provide default Channel settings and other configuration values in the <A
			href="preferences.html">Preferences</A>. Finally, you can search your Channels using the <A
			href="search-dialog.html">Search</A> dialog.</P>
		<H2>Link browsers</H2>
		<P>You may choose, using the Channel Properties dialog, how to view the contents of channel and item links. By default, two methods are available: </P>
		<OL>
			<LI>Using the configured Help Browser</LI>
			<LI>Using a file editor
		that understands the article format (e.g., HTML)</LI>
		</OL>
		<P>In addition, users
		of WSAD running under MS-Windows have an option to use its embedded
		web browser. 3rd-party providers may offer additional link browsers.</P>
		<H2>RSS feed translators</H2>
		<P>RSS feeds based on various formats and versions are translated into a uniform channel model, which allows the various RSS views to present their contents in a uniform fashion. The default translator understands RSS versions 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, 1.0, and 2.0. 3rd-party providers may offer translators for new RSS versions, or entirely different formats.</P>
		<H2>Periodic updates</H2>
		<P>For each channel you may specify an interval, in minutes, which dictates how often the channel's contents are updated from its source feed. After an update, any new items are flagged and displayed with different icons and colors in the various RSS views, until they are read (i.e., opened using a link browser).</P>
		<H2>Channel content caching</H2>
		<P>RSS channels are represented in the workspace as files, which contain information on where to get the updates, how often, etc. The channel content, after an update, is cached in a temporary location outside of workspace. Thus it is possible to share the channel files using a Version Control System (e.g., CVS); each user then gets its own copy of the channel contents.
