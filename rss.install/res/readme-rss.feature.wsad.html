<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>Eclipse RSS Reader allows you to subscribe to and browse Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds. Because it is based on the <A
	href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</A> platform, it seamlessly integrates with IBM's WebSphere Studio Application Developer v5.1. Its plug-in-based architecture allows it to adapt to a variety of RSS formats.</P>
<P>For more information about the Eclipse RSS Reader, please visit <A

<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>After reading and accepting the license agreement, you will be prompted to choose the packages to install. The <EM>Base</EM> package contains the application itself, including user documentation, and is required. The <EM>Sources</EM> package is optional and contains Java source code and developer documentation for the application. It is recommended for developers who want to extend the Eclipse RSS Reader.</P>
<P>Next, you will be asked to enter a location where the application will be installed. If you provide a path to a directory that does not exist, it will be created for you.</P>
<P>Lastly, you will be prompted to enter the location of your WSAD. This is required because the Eclipse RSS Reader is built as an extension of the IBM WebSphere Studio Application Developer v5.1. You must provide the path to a directory that contains your WSAD installation (e.g., <EM>c:\Program
Files\IBM\WebSphere Studio\Application Developer\v5.1</EM> in Windows, or <EM>/opt/IBM/WebSphereStudio/ApplicationDeveloper/v5.1</EM> in Unix).</P>
<H3>Uninstalling the application</H3>
<P>As part of the installation procedure, an uninstaller is automatically created that will allow you to completely remove this application. To invoke it, execute <CODE>java
-jar &lt;INSTALL_PATH&gt;/Uninstaller/uninstaller.jar</CODE>, where <EM>&lt;INSTALL_PATH&gt;</EM> is the directory where you install this application.</P>
