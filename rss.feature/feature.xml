      Publishing web-based news of all kinds via a summary format (RSS)
is becoming increasingly popular. The applications include regular
headline news (Yahoo! News), web logs (Slashdot.org), professional
bulletins (IBM developerWorks), and project updates (SourceForge.net).
A variety of RSS formats currently exist, which increases application
complexity. Often, a reader capable of understanding one format
cannot handle another. The solution presented herein takes advantage
of Eclipse platform in the following ways:
1. Extension points and plug-in based architecture support addition
of new channel formats.
2. Workbench provides user interface consistency for users of
existing Eclipse-based tools (I for one like to keep up-to-date
while working in JDT).
3. Resource and UI model provides opportunities for integration
with other Eclipse-based tools.
