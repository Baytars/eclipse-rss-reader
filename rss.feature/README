Eclipse RSS Reader

Publishing web-based news of all kinds via a summary format (RSS) is becoming increasingly popular. The applications include regular headline news (Yahoo! News), web logs (Slashdot.org), professional bulletins (IBM developerWorks), and project updates (SourceForge.net). A variety of RSS formats currently exist, which increases application complexity. Often, a reader capable of understanding one format cannot handle another. The solution presented herein takes advantage of Eclipse platform in the following ways:
1. Extension points and plug-in based architecture support addition of new channel formats.
2. Workbench provides user interface consistency for users of existing Eclipse-based tools (I for one like to keep up-to-date while working in JDT).
3. Resource and UI model provides opportunities for integration with other Eclipse-based tools.

Pre-requisites
============
1. Eclipse 2.1
2. JDK 1.4 (dependency on JAXP/Xalan)
3. Internet connection

Developed and tested on Slackware Linux 9.1 w/ GTK, and MS Windows 2000.

Installation
========
Unzip the feature archive into your Eclipse installation directory.

Getting Started
===============
1. Start your Workbench with a new or pre-existing workspace. Switch to the Resource perspective. If the workspace  is empty, create a new project.
2. In Resource Navigator, right-click on a folder and select New -> RSS Channel.
3. Enter a URL for the RSS Channel; e.g., http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/news/dw_tech_nl.rss. Click "Load".
4. Select the default translator and click Next.
5. Enter a filename (with *.rss extension) and click Finish.
6. Select the newly created file in Resource Navigator. From the main menu, select Navigate -> Show In -> Channel  Navigator and/or Channel Detail.
7. Browse and/or create channels in the Channel Navigator. Open the Properties view to see properties of selected  items. Double-click on selected items to read the channel or item link.

Features
========
1. Uniform channel model
RSS Feeds of various versions are coerced into a uniform channel model, which is persisted in the workspace.  Third-party plug-ins may contribute "translators" for various channel formats. The default implementation handles  RSS 0.91, 0.92, 1.0, and 2.0. In case more than one registered translator understands a format, the user is given a  choice to select one they wish to use. In the future, annonymous elements external to the model will be exposed via  untyped property interface (map), thus giving access to third-party plug-ins that may understand them.

2. Periodic updates
Based on user specification, channels are periodically updated from the source. All viewers are refreshed to display  up-to-date information. In the future, markers will be used to identify changes and allow viewers to highlight them.

3. Property page
Individual channel files have a property page with RSS-specific options.

4. Preference page
Preference page allows the user to specify default values.

5. New Channel wizard
Allows users to create new channels from an external RSS feed source.

6. Channel Navigator
Allows users to navigate channels in container hierarchy.

7. Channel Detail view
Allows users to view details of selected channel.

TODO
=====
1. User documentation (plug-in), context help, javadoc.
2. Internationalization (externalize strings into resource bundles).
3. Improve channel change delta; mark changed items with resource markers; extend views to highlight changed items until user reads them.
4. Expose data external to the core model via mapped properties so other plug-ins may consume them.
5. Multi-page channel editor to allow user to modify the channel.
