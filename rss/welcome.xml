<intro><p>Publishing web-based news of all kinds via a summary format (RSS)
is becoming increasingly popular. The applications include regular headline 
news (Yahoo! News), web logs (Slashdot.org), professional bulletins 
(IBM developerWorks), and project updates (SourceForge.net). A variety of RSS 
formats currently exist, which increases application complexity. Often, a reader
capable of understanding one format cannot handle another. The Eclipse RSS 
Reader takes advantage of Eclipse platform in the following ways:</p>
<p>1. Extension points and plug-in based architecture support addition of new 
channel formats.</p>
<p>2. Workbench provides user interface consistency for users of existing 
Eclipse-based tools (I for one like to keep up-to-date while working in JDT).</p>
<p>3. Resource and UI model provides opportunities for integration with other 
Eclipse-based tools.</p>
</intro>

<item><b>Getting Started</b>
<p>1. Start your Workbench with a new or pre-existing workspace. If the 
workspace  is empty, create a new project.</p>
<p>2. In Resource Navigator, right-click on a folder and select New -&gt; RSS 
Channel.</p>
<p>3. Enter a URL for the RSS Channel; e.g., 
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/news/dw_tech_nl.rss. Click "Load".</p>
<p>4. Select the default translator and click Next.</p>
<p>5. Enter a filename (with *.rss extension) and click Finish.</p>
<p>6. Select the newly created file in Resource Navigator. From the main menu, 
select Navigate -&gt; Show In -&gt; Channel  Navigator and/or Channel Detail.
</p>
<p>7. Browse and/or create channels in the Channel Navigator. Open the 
Properties view to see properties of selected items. Double-click on selected 
items to read the channel or item link.</p>

<item><b>Features</b>
<p><b>1. Uniform channel model</b></p>
<p>RSS Feeds of various versions are coerced into a uniform channel model, 
which is persisted in the workspace. Third-party plug-ins may contribute 
"translators" for various channel formats. The default implementation handles  
RSS 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, 1.0, and 2.0. In case more than one registered translator 
understands a format, the user is given a choice to select one they wish to use.
In the future, annonymous elements external to the model will be exposed via 
untyped property interface (map), thus making them available to third-party 
plug-ins that may understand and use them in a specific way.</p>

<p><b>2. Periodic updates</b></p>
<p>Based on user specification, channels are periodically updated from the 
source. All viewers are refreshed to display up-to-date information. In the 
future, markers will be used to identify changes and allow viewers to highlight 
them.</p>

<p><b>3. Property page</b></p>
<p>Individual channel files have a property page with RSS-specific options,
such as update interval, source translator, and link browser.</p>

<p><b>4. Preference page</b></p>
<p>Preference page allows the user to specify default values for update interval
and link browser. In addition, default link browsers (help and editor) have
their own category; the former allows the user to select which configured help
browser to use, and the latter which editor to use to browse articles.</p>

<p><b>5. New Channel wizard</b></p>
<p>Allows users to create new channels from an external RSS feed.</p>

<p><b>6. Channel Navigator</b></p>
<p>Allows users to navigate channels in a project/folder hierarchy.</p>

<p><b>7. Channel Detail view</b></p>
<p>Allows users to view details of selected channel, such as title and
description. Supports sorting by column.</p>

<p><b>8. Pluggable News Article Browsers</b></p>
<p>Users may choose how to view the contents of news articles. By default,
two methods are available: 1). Using the configured Help Browser, or 2).
Using a file editor that understands the article format (e.g., HTML).
In addition, users of WSAD running under MS-Windows have an option to use 
its Web Browser Editor. This option is specifiable on a per-channel basis.
3rd-party provides may offer additional methods via the provided extension 
point.</p>
